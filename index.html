                    <p>
                    <p>First we must discuss what DIY HRT even means 
                    <p> <img src="p2.png" alt="DIY HRT is a form of taking medication without need for a doctor specifically HRT. There is typically no making of one's own medicine rather taking what others have made medicines are perscription grade and very safe 
                                                It is in a legal grey area estrogen (and other meds for trans women) have no legal risks but imports may be seized 
                                                testosterone is a controled substance but carries no more risk">
                    <p> Without a doctor is the most important element similar to  
                    <p> over the counter medications HRT has little to no side effects 
                    <p> 
                    <p> 
                    <p> <img src="p3.png" alt="DIY is for you if 1. Seeing a doctor is not possible 2. Cost is a major concern 3. Simple desire to, or one of many other reasons">
                    <p>Personal reasons vary greatly 
                    <p>For me it was a lack of access and want to DIY
                    <p>Why one wants to is not particularly important 
                        beyone being certain that you want HRT </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p><img src="p4.png"alt="pills, patches, and injections" >  </p>
                    <p>There are four major ways to take HRT </p>
                    <p>First is pills which is the easiest to acquire but also requires an anti-androgen(AA)  </p> 
                    <p>there are three major types of AA, spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, and bicalutamide  </p>
                    <p>spiro is not an AA first, rather a diuretic, but is rather cheap </p>
                    <p>cypro is taken in fairly low doseage (10mg/2days) and is not too hard to get but can have bad side effects </p>
                    <p>bica has fewest side effects but is very expensive</p>
                    <p>Pill estrogen requires the highest dose of 6-8mg per day, if taken sublingually, and more if swallowed </p>
                    <p>pills also pass through the liver putting strain on it </p>
                    <p></p><p>Patches and gel are both applied to the skin, bypassing the liver </p>
                    <p>patches have doseing info on them, gel depends greatly on concentration </p>
                    <p>both of these methods can be done with or without an AA which adds to varying dose</p>
                    <p></p><p>Injections are the best category if you can deal with needles </p>
                    <p>They carry the lowest risks and are cheapest per week and have zero need for an AA for most everyone</p>
                    <p>doseage depends on the kind being taken, ranging from 4-5mg/5days with estradiol valerate(EV) to </p>
                    <p>7-8mg/week with estradiol enantate(EEN) or estradiol cypionate(EC) to 32mg/month with estradiol undecylate(EUn) </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p><img src="p5.png" alt="Done online on one of many sites
some carry different types and may be pharmaceutical or homebrewed 
Many require use of cryptocurrency for payment due to added security and anonymity"> </p>
                    <p> Various websites are used by sellers which can be found at databases such as </p>
                    <p><a href="https://hrtcafe.net">hrt cafe</a>, <a href="https://diyhrt.market/"> diyhrt.market</a>, and <a href="https://diyhrt.info/"> diyhrt.info</a> which also has other useful information </p>
                    <p>many sellers require the used of cryptocurrency for transactions due to everything being legally grey, however crypto is <br>generally not too hard to use and there are many guides for how to access and use it  </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p><img src="p6.png" alt="Next steps if you order it will take 2-8 weeks to arrive depending on from who  starting dosage will depend on type and can be adjusted  ideally blood tests for estrogen and testosterone will happen once every 3 months for the first year or after dose changes they are not essential but help provide more info"  </p>
                    <p>Once an order is placed you will wait a few weeks for it to arrive at which leads to the whole point of doing this! <br> dosage information has already been discussed and will vary somewhat between people. <br> blood tests, while important to ensuring safety nad effectiveness is not essential<br> unfortunately diy is not a widely accepted method however you can use your own judgement as to if sharing that you are on HRT with others is swomething you want to do</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p><img src="p7.png" alt="The greatest risk is of it doing nothing due to low dosage Costs may be high due to seized packages  Allergic reactions to any medicine  social disproval  needing to start officially for surgeries">  </p>
                    <p>As with anything there are risks with diy, mostly in terms of allergies, unexpected costs, incorrect dose, and social issues <br> These risks are not common and the most severe are not recurring   </p>
